# Wedding Invites Application

## Introduction
This is a full stack application for a wedding invitation. Wedding planners can use this app to track exactly the number of guests they would have and in turn plan ahead effectively. It also notifies the organisers via mail when a user fills the form on the site. It is built with NextJS, tailwindcss and shadcn ui for frontend, supabase for backend and database and Resend for email notifications .

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
